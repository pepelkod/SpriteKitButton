SpriteKitButton
===============

Simple Sprite Kit Button Class

This project attempts to provide an easy-to-use class for adding text buttons to a sprite kit scene.

If a text button is not explicitly positioned on the scene, it will be placed sequentially from top to
bottom in the order they are created - pending any other explicitly positioned buttons.
Padding can be specified to give more spacing between buttons.

TODO: 
1.Create methods for starting starting buttons relative to a programmer-specified position
instead of just from the top. I.E. Half and quarter start positions.

2.Find better images to use for button textures and incorparte some examples of using the centerRect property.
